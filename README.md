Use the following criteria to set your environment variables:

*  `.env` - Common variables that are not specific to any environment.

*  `.env.development` - Variables that are only specific to `development` or `test` environments.

*  `.env.production` - Variables that are only specific to production environment. Example: `ENTRY`.

  

```{shell}

# POSTRESQL DATABASE

DEV_DB_USER='database_username'

DEV_DB_PASSWORD='database_password'

DEV_DB_NAME='database_name'

  

# DOMAIN

CURRENT_SITE_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8080/

  

# SENTRY

SENTRY_DNS=8.8.8.8

  

# COMMON_API_CREDS

REACT_APP_API_URL=https://myApiServerUrl.com

```

NB:

* Ensure you use the prefix `REACT_APP_` to store all the variables that are needed in the React Application. Example: `REACT_APP_NAME=janedoe`

*  **DO NOT** commit any of the environment files to version control.
